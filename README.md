# Lending-Club-Payback-Prediction

## Problem Overview
Lending Club is a lending company that connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor, anyone would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

The problem at hand is to predict the people who have high probablity of paying back the money as compared to those who dont. Since it is a classification problem, a good way to approach it is by Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithm
